This is an initial version of the package metamicrobiomeR.   

To start, please download and view the steps/examples/workflow in the tutorial file "metamicrobiomeR_Supplementary_file". 

The metamicrobiomeR package implements Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) 
    with zero inflated beta (BEZI) family for analysis of microbiome relative abundance data and 
    random effect meta-analysis models for meta-analysis pooling estimates across microbiome studies.
    Random Forest model to predict microbiome age based on relative abundances of  
    shared bacterial genera with the Bangladesh data (Subramanian et al 2014), 
    comparison of multiple diversity indexes using linear/linear mixed effect models 
    and some data display/visualization are also implemented.

The paper describing the methods implemented in the "metamicrobiomeR" package as well as simulations, and example analyses/results are now available in preprint at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/04/294678.
